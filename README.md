# Akinator
This is akinator - a program that guesses what you guess. Also, an akinator can define an object or compare two objects.
Akinator has 5 operating modes. 1 - guess the object 
(if the object is not in the akinator's library, then it asks for the distinctive property of the object and adds the object to the library when saving). 
2 - give the definition of the object, if it is in the library. 3 - compare two objects, 4 - save, 5 - exit the game. 
We also store objects in a graphic file in the form of a binary tree, where the answer is yes to the left and no to the right.
